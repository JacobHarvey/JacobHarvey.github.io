Alright, this is my first blog post ever and is written for CS 378: Generic Programming and the STL. The following series of posts with the titles of “Week x” will be written in respect to my summer programming class and my thoughts/ inspirations of the previous week.
	I’m currently working as a Teaching Assistant at the University of Texas for CS 429: Computer Architecture and am also taking a computer science class called “Generic Programming and the STL” which is C++ based and is focused on the standard library and the finer points of C++ and programming.
	The class has been intimidating so far. The professor, Glenn Downing, wants to prepare us (the students) for the real world/ working in the industry. He is requiring us to use a slew of programs in conjunction with our programming to improve our code and its flexibility. The programs are: Travis CI, GoogleTest, Doxygen, Git, and Gcov. I’m already experience with Git, having used it for group projects in the past. The other programs don’t look terribly hard, but I’ve yet to look at their documentation/ implementation. While the requirements look daunting, I’m glad that I have to learn these programs. My goal for the summer is to improve my coding skills by making a website, learning a new language, and working on some InfoSec skills. By learning these programs, I’ll gain some helpful skills/ tools for my future. 
	The class focuses on teaching the fine-grain details of C++, and by in doing so, the finer points of programming. I took this class on my friend’s recommendation, and I’m happy I’m doing so. I, like many other students, learned programming by copying and pasting from various sources on the internet. I’m not talking about whole blocks of code, but simple things like what arguments main() takes in C files or how to concat strings, etc. When I learned coding in High School, I had no idea what the computer was really doing. I didn’t know that dividing took way more resources that multiplying, or that temp variables are stored on the stack (what is the stack?). Now, I hope to fill in the missing knowledge and how to code efficiently and simply. For example, we went over C++’s ++ operand, and how ++j is better than j++. We’ve gone over how to pass arguments from a function to another, and why we should primarily pass by reference (not sure what it’s called, but by using & in c++). The information covered is not easy; I feel like I’ll have to read a couple of C++ text books in order to study for the exam. Hell, I could probably use my notes to write my own text book. I feel like I’m constantly writing in this class; more so than any other computer science class I’ve taken. The new vocabulary, ideas, and techniques are challenging to memorize, but I’m confident I can handle it.
